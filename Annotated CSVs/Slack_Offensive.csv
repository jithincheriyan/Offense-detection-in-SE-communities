 gt First of all ever heard of the zero one infinity rule Second of all fuck you and your element max comparable tuples Anyway The real thing I want to discuss is how comparable is magical compiler stuff I d argue that whenever magical compiler stuff rears its head things are going to get arbitrary and stupid gt Lo and behold things get arbitrary and stupid around comparable Since it s compiler magic we mere mortals are unable to make our instances of comparable which is to say you can t use any custom data types as the key of a dictionary in Elm ,0.8845259,1,1,0,1
 gt Elm takes a very peculiar stance on libraries Libraries which don t have the blessing of Czaplicki himself allegedly aren t allowed to be published gt What The Fuck I had the same reaction when I learned that only blessed modules can now have Native code The reasoning is sound for published packages but the argument for removing it for users and developers was then they would make a third party package manager that contains native code and this is apparently a very bad thing ,0.7449346,1,0,0,1

Now to explain we basically made a function that picks out the values of the current dict without strictly looking at the keys I E just passing them around then it passes that map to a filter where we remove any empty dicts that the map function produced Finally we loop over the result of the filter in order to recursively call each dict which is one or more items inside the filter result we do this until the time when the collection is no longer a dict and thus we are no longer able to loop map filter over it meaning we got our final value This is where it gets FUCKY return is not your average being It doesn t give a shit about your day it won t care that you got an A in that one exam So return basically passes along whatever value is computed And because of our recursion if we simply tried to write return collection in the else block we would return None That s right I STILL haven t figured out WHY better than the fact that return is a bastard So the hacky bit here is that we pass in a results collection as almost like a callback and only append to it when the result is our bottom most value for any given dict Which should solve the issue but makes my brain hurt ,0.79342544,1,1,0,1
