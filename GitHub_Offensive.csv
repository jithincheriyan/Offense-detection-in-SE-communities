This is a very obvious and stupid bug which somehow escaped notice but finally manifested on Android probably due to a larger audio buffer in SDL audio callback you re supposed to fill in the silence bytes when you don t have enough sound to play Failing to do so leads to garbage in the sound buffer and consequently clicking popping sounds being played after each sound ,0.7108646,1,1,0,0

Hello so after our announcement stating the rules about posting issues on GitHub This announcement doesn t seem to be getting to peoples heads so we are going to make it so clear about what to post and not what to post If you post a stupid issue it will be closed n nMost asked questions n n I have an error in my console n nThis is most likely to be your fault due to a conflicting plugin We do not I repeat DO NOT upload a build of BlockHunt if it has an error in the console so if you do get an error then it is YOUR FAULT n nSo how do you fix it Well firstly try and remove ALL of your BlockHunt files Between builds we update what goes in and out of the config files so this means you will get an error in the console if you do not delete your BlockHunt files between updates This may seem like a horrible task to do but people ask for new things to be added to the plugin so we add them in thus there are consequences to servers n nIf the error contains any words from any other plugins then it is a conflicting plugin Do not post an issue about this or else it will be closed n nNow if the error is an legit error that has occurred and you re sure that it isn t a conflicting plugin then post it as soon as n n n n Signs don t work n nThen install the god damn plugins needed to run the plugin n n n n Players cannot hurt each other n nCheck every single PvP setting that you can see I mean every single setting We test BlockHunt to make sure that players can hit each other DO NOT post an issue about PvP as it will be closed n n n n BRING DISGUISECRAFT BACK n nNo n n n n I can t see the piston heads in the settings menu n nGet the latest build of BlockHunt then n n n n I can t find the BlockHunt download link n nThis issue is a pretty big one because of Bukkits rules We cannot post Dev builds of BlockHunt at all However you can get Dev builds through here blockhunt comxa com n n n n Seekers spawn early n nThey don t you need to block off their spawn The hiders spawn and have a chance to run away then the seekers will spawn in the hiders spawn to find them get it now n n n n Spigot crashes n nWe DO NOT support Spigot n n n n MCPC crashes n nOh my gaw We DO NOT support MCPC n n n n Permissions don t work n nUse a permissions manager then n n n nSo do as we say or else your issue will be closed n n So how do I get the Dev s of BlockHunt to solve my issue n nEasy we are always looking for new bugs to fix and new features to add to this great plugin however we are normally dealing with the stupid people who decide to post complete rubbish for an issue n nIf you want to get your issue sorted out then follow this to do list n n Update to the latest Dev build see if this fixes your error n Check no plugins are conflicting n Check all of your pvp settings n nIf you have tried this and it doesn t work then make an issue following these guidelines n nhttp postimg org image ow rvkl n n n Add your CraftBukkit Version n Add your BlockHunt version n Add a description of the issue including steps to reproduce the issue THE ISSUE MUST BE IN FLUENT ENGLISH n Add pictures if you can n Add the correct tag n nThank you for your co operation n nSteffion RandomPanda n,0.7246556,1,1,0,0
